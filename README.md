# HospitalReadmission
In this project I will demonstrate how to build a model predicting readmission for patients with diabetes in Python using the following steps

data exploration
feature engineering
building training/validation/test samples
model selection
model evaluation
Project Definition
Predict if a patient with diabetes will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days.

Data set exploration
The data that is used in this project originally comes from the UCI machine learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008). The data consists of over 100000 hospital admissions from patients with diabetes from 130 US hospitals between 1999-2008.

In this project, we have created a binary classifier to predict the probability that a patient with diabetes would be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days. 
On our test data, the best performing model had an AUC of 0.87
